# My keymap - Rationale

My keymap was built with these principles in mind:

* *Dvorak first*: as it is my prefered layout; I kept QWERTY as I may want to
  use it someday; I also kept Colemak, aldough I will probably never use it;
* *Alternate hands*, instead of making awkard chords: I placed Shift, Ctrl,
  Alt, GUI and Enter keys for both hands, so instead of making chords for
  combinations like `Shift+E` or `Ctrl+T` I can use both hands;
* *Lower layer activates keys for the Right hand*: the key that activates the
  lower layer is located for the left hand's thumb, so it is preferable to
  use the right hand fingers;
* *Raise layer activates keys for the Left hand*: the opposite of the
  previous topic;
